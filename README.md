Your Project's Name
'Project Example Idea 2 - Website for fictional company'

My Fictional Company will sell Football Cleats to people. We will provide good quality cleats for our customers in Singapore so they need not ship their orders from overseas.

Design Process
I have designed a website for the shopping or Football boots. My website helps categorise the boots into the different brands availabel which allows for ease of shopping and finding the desired product.

As a user, I would like to see which boots are in the trend right now so I know what is nice.

As a user, I would like to navigate the websites easily with simple clicks.

As a user, I would like to view/filter the different items available by brands for easier browsing.

As a user, I would like to see the company's beginnings and mission to see what kind of company they are like.
